# Random_forest
The Jupyter Notebook, titled "Random_forest.ipynb," demonstrates the implementation of a Random Forest classifier for a binary classification task. It starts with importing necessary libraries and loading a dataset, followed by preprocessing steps that include splitting the data into training and test sets. The Random Forest model is then trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy score, and a classification report. The model achieves an accuracy of 76%, with detailed metrics provided for precision, recall, and F1-score
